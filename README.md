# Kauãn Kelvin – 🙂

Hi, I'm Kauãn.

I like code that works in silence — like a well-tuned pocket watch.  
My days are spent between lines of C# and JavaScript; my nights, learning how machines think.

**What do I do?** I turn complex problems into simple solutions.  
No fluff — just what works, and works well.

## 🌱 Currently:
- Learning JavaScript and React at my own pace  
- Refactoring a legacy system with care  
- Reading about clean architecture (and slowly applying it)

## 🪑 I believe technology should be like good furniture:
- **Useful** (solves real needs)  
- **Durable** (survives updates)  
- **Discreet** (gets the job done without drawing attention)

## ☕ Let's talk about:
- The art of simplifying systems  
- Tech books that actually teach something  
- The perfect coffee-to-code ratio
